<p>Dear Syndey,</p>
<p>Sorry for not putting beak to paper before now, but you know it is these days in the jungle. I don’t get the time to do anything relaxing.  When the wife’s ill and there’s the kids to look after, I don’t get the time. My son demonstrated to me his low flying capabilities which I advise him against using too often. It is surprising how many parrots you hear of these days getting wiped out by low flying. Fellow the other day got caught in a creeper and was strung up like I don’t know what.</p>
<p>I suppose you don’t get much chance to do a spot of flying. Anyway I don’t see much need for you to fly around since you’ve got it all laid on, a nice warm cage, food and water whenever you want. We don’t have such luxuries here.
The main reason I write is to tell you the latest about is happening my area. I said the wife’s been ill, well for a treat for her and the kids (I stopped my son’s low flying antics), I took them to a small spot I once discovered on my travels. It is a nice spot with a large selection of food if I remember rightly. When I arrived had quite a shock. Just before we arrived we stopped for a little rest, and I had a little look on ahead to see if were on right track since it was long time since I was in that area. When I flown a few vines further on, I though I head a strange sort of noise, not one which I had ever heard before. Being an inquisitive sort of bird I ventured even further. Quite a number of vines later on I came to what I believed was one the clearing that I remembered. However, I discovered to be horror and disgust that the humans had transformed it into one of their massive great hard grey things that I had heard about on grapevine. From what I could see, it covered an area thousands of us parrots could live in and it would take several days to travel the length of it. My wondrous clearing had been totally destroyed along what all the food in it. I notice several other parrots around about so I went over and introduced myself.</p>
<p>I don’t really know what this object was supposed to be and the parrots showed me some other humans who apparently were not in favour of this thing. They had sticks and were throwing at this noisy yellow object, that was lurching around the place. Apparently they had once lived there and now they had nowhere to live. Some other people had pieces of wood which they had written “NO BYPASS” on.</p>
<p>Well I don’t know what the world is coming to, really I don’t. I must fly on now.</p>
<p>Regards, Wilberforce.</p>
